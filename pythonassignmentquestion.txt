DOWN 3	moved down 3
LEFT 3	moved left 3
RIGHT 2	moved right 2
LEFT 1	moved left 1
Down 5	moved down 5

Then, the output of the program should be:

5

	The class should have following functions "can use xlrd"

	OpenExcelFile( Filename )				- Returns pointer / handle to opened file
	GetWorksheetData ( Worksheet Name )		- Gets all data on specified worksheet for previously opened excel file
	GetWorksheetRange ( Worksheet Name, Row1, Col1, Row2, Col2 ) 	- Gets range of cells

14) Implement a Http / Websocket server using which 2 different python scripts can communicate with each other.


15) Define a class employee with properties name and code. When we print the object of the class as below,

	e1 = EMployee("XXX", 12345)
	print (e1)

	It should give output as

	Name = XXX
	Code = 12345

16) Write a python script that compares 2 XML files and list the difference between them.

17) Write a python script that compares 2 JSON files and list the difference between them.

18) Write a python script that takes UTF 16 encoded file and converts it to UTF 8.

19) Write a python rule processor that processes a XML file containing rules such as example below -

	Context	= Person
	Condition = Age > 60
	Action = Retired = True

	When a python script calls the Run function for a Rule class by passing a Person object as parameter, it will set the Retired property to True if the condition evaluates to True i.e. Age of person is > 60 in this case.

20) Write a python program that merges the text file with data elements and generates merged output.

	For example, given below text file -

	Dear {{Name}},

	We are pleased to confirm your booking dated {{Date}} at {{Property}}.
